* Mongo database is hosted on Mongo Atlas and the backend/API server fetches data from there.
* Data has been mocked hence some things may look strange, e.g. start of US but country set to something else. This has no impact on the functionality since we only `states` for the logic/functionality.
* Not all records have everything, e.g. not all colleges have related colleges since data is genearted using faker though care has been taken that certain matching records exit. For example, this college `https://collegeapp.quosera.com/college/61893d89d00b74b68d4004a6` has a related college.
* Have tried to make data linkable as much as possible so you can click on college titles, course tags and states. Further, you can also use the search option.
